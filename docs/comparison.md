## How we're different

- GPTCache: Python-first. Resk-Caching targets Bun/TypeScript with a secured HTTP API, OpenAPI, metrics, tracing, and optional encryption.
- ModelCache: Adds semantic caching. Resk-Caching includes production-grade concerns (rate limit, JWT, OTEL/Prometheus, WebSockets) and pluggable backends.
- Upstash Semantic Cache: Managed service. Resk-Caching is open-source, self-hosted by default, supports local dev with SQLite/memory.
- Redis LangCache: Managed Redis-based cache. Resk-Caching supports Redis natively and also SQLite/memory for portability.
- SemantiCache (FAISS): FAISS-native. Resk-Caching prioritizes a secure, observable API surface and external vector DB adapters without GPU requirements.
